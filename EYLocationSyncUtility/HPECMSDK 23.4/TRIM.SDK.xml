             <summary>
             The DownloadNotifier class provides a streaming interface to document transfers from the workgroup server to the SDK application. During
             document transfers from the workgroup server to the SDK application, the OnChunkAvailable event is called, to provide real-time notifications
             of the bytes that are being transferred. This allows the SDK application to access the bytes of the document, before the document
             has been transferred in its entirety, and is particularly useful for streaming documents onwards from the SDK application to a subsequent receiver.
             
             DownloadNotifier provides a unified streaming interface for documents, regardless of whether the document is already present in 
             the local document cache or not. In the case of a document residing in the local document cache, all bytes will be notified immediately.
             
             The following is a simple example of how to use DownloadNotifier.
             
                 private void Notifier_OnChunkAvailable(byte[] chunk, long chunkPos, long chunkLen, bool lastChunk)
                 {
                     // ...
                 }
            
                 Record rec = new Record(db, "Some Record");
                 int chunkSize = 5000;
                 int startingPosition = 0;
                 int endingPosition = -1;
                 using (DownloadNotifier notifier = new DownloadNotifier(db, chunkSize, startingPosition, endingPosition))
                 {
                     notifier.OnChunkAvailable += Notifier_OnChunkAvailable;
                     string downloadTo = "C:\\Some Record.doc";
                     rec.GetDocument(downloadTo, false, "", "");

             <summary>
              The TrimObjectChangeNotifier class provides a global notification mechanism for when Content
              Manager business objects are changed. The notifications specify the object type and the object URI
              of the changed object, and allows the recipient to take relevant actions, such as refreshing
              cached objects.

             <summary>
             The WgsProgressNotifier class provides a mechanism for SDK applications to receive progress updates while the SDK is communicating with
             a workgroup server. It also allows SDK applications to cancel ongoing operations.
             
             When a WgsProgressNotifier is constructed, it is associated with a Database instance, and when the Database instance is interacting 
             with a workgroup server, WgsProgressNotifier will periodically call a user-specified event (WgsProgressNotifier.OnWgsProgress), with 
             information about the currently executing operation (see the WgsProgressInfo class).
             
             It is possible for the application to cancel ongoing workgroup server operations, by setting WgsProgressInfo.ShouldCancel to true.
             
             The following is a simple example of how to use WgsProgressNotifier.
             
                 private void Notifier_OnWgsProgress(WgsProgressInfo progressInfo)

                         System.Console.WriteLine("Elapsed time for current operation (ms): " + progressInfo.WgsMethodElapsedMs);
                     }
                     
                     if (progressInfo.IsDownloadingFile || progressInfo.IsUploadingFile)

                             "Transferring {0} bytes. Percentage transferred so far: {1}", 
                             progressInfo.FileTransferTotalSize, 
                             progressInfo.FileTransferPerCentCompleted);
                             
                         System.Console.WriteLine(msg);

            <summary>
            Gets or sets a boolean value indicating whether Locations should be processed immediately. When using the bulkloader for creating locations, it is often difficult to use these locations because the bulkloader approach means the location details are not available for verification purposes until after the batch commit step, which is a call to the ProcessAccumulatedData() method. In particular, using imported locations as:     Record Assignee, Record Home or Record Owner, require a location that exists in the database. For a value of true, Locations will be saved to the database as soon as they are encountered, i.e. during the SubmitLocation() method. Searching for the Location will return a result, thus avoiding a duplicate Location from being created. This turns bulkloading off for Locations and the Location is processed in the same way as it would be using the standard SDK methods to create a Location. If set to false (default), Locations will be saved to the database when the batch is processed, i.e. after a call to ProcessAccumulatedData(). Searching for the Location prior to this will not yield a successful result.

            Gets or sets a boolean indicating whether document storage operations using the asynchronous pending folder on the workgroup server.  Using the pending folder may speed up response times in some user interface scenarios, however it is not recommended when running intensive server side document updates.  If you wish to guarantee safe delivery of the document, it is also recommended to not use the pending folder.  Note also, the Pending Folder can only be used if it is configired for the workgroup.

            <summary>
            Provides configuration of the global database connection pool. Because the database connection pool is global, only a single instance of the DatabaseConnectionPool class may be created. <para/> The global database connection pool allows you to reuse network connections across multiple Database objects. Calling Database.Connect() is a relatively expensive operation, especially in applications that create a potentially large number of Database objects. The database connection pool optimizes this by caching network connections and reusing them in subsequent Database.Connect() calls. When a Database object is disposed, the connection is automatically returned to the database connection pool. <para/> Connection pooling operates transparently, but only applies for Database objects for which the Id, WorkgroupServerName and TrustedUser properties have been set. Note that all three of these properties must be set, for connection pooling to be enabled. <para/> The DatabaseConnectionPool class implements the IDisposable interface. DatabaseConnectionPool objects must be properly disposed by your program, either by calling Dispose () in a 'finally' clause, or with a 'using' clause.

            Note that the IEnumerator documentation requires an InvalidOperationException to be thrown
            whenever the collection is modified. This has been done for changes in the size of the
            collection but not when one of the elements of the collection is modified as it is a bit
            tricky to detect unmanaged code that modifies the collection under our feet.

            Note that the IEnumerator documentation requires an InvalidOperationException to be thrown
            whenever the collection is modified. This has been done for changes in the size of the
            collection but not when one of the elements of the collection is modified as it is a bit
            tricky to detect unmanaged code that modifies the collection under our feet.

            Note that the IEnumerator documentation requires an InvalidOperationException to be thrown
            whenever the collection is modified. This has been done for changes in the size of the
            collection but not when one of the elements of the collection is modified as it is a bit
            tricky to detect unmanaged code that modifies the collection under our feet.

            Note that the IEnumerator documentation requires an InvalidOperationException to be thrown
            whenever the collection is modified. This has been done for changes in the size of the
            collection but not when one of the elements of the collection is modified as it is a bit
            tricky to detect unmanaged code that modifies the collection under our feet.

            Note that the IEnumerator documentation requires an InvalidOperationException to be thrown

            Note that the IEnumerator documentation requires an InvalidOperationException to be thrown
            whenever the collection is modified. This has been done for changes in the size of the
            collection but not when one of the elements of the collection is modified as it is a bit
            tricky to detect unmanaged code that modifies the collection under our feet.

            Note that the IEnumerator documentation requires an InvalidOperationException to be thrown
            whenever the collection is modified. This has been done for changes in the size of the
            collection but not when one of the elements of the collection is modified as it is a bit
            tricky to detect unmanaged code that modifies the collection under our feet.

            collection but not when one of the elements of the collection is modified as it is a bit

            The TrimAccessControlList class is used to encapsulate the access controls that can be applied to an object an access control list consists of an array of entries that control who has access to a particular restricted function. These restricted functions may differ depending upon which object the access control list applies to, for example a meeting object may wish to restrict who can 'Take Minutes'. Each object that support access control lists will have an enum describing its set of restricted functions - in this class, the elements of this enum are simple defined as an int.
